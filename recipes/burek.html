            <!-- Recipe Description -->
            <p><strong>Meat Burek:</strong> A Bosnian delicacy.</p>
             <p>Burek is a <em>savory</em> pastry popular across the Balkans and the Middle East, 
            made with thin layers of dough filled with ingredients like minced meat, 
            cheese, or vegetables. It's known for its flaky texture and rich, satisfying taste. 
            Burek can be shaped into spirals, coils, or layered pies and is typically baked until 
            golden brown and crispy on the outside.</p>
      
            <p>Making a burek pastry begins with preparing the dough, though some modern recipes opt for store-bought phyllo. 
            Traditional burek dough is made by mixing flour, water, salt, and a touch of oil into a soft, elastic dough. 
            After kneading, the dough is rested, then divided into smaller balls and brushed with oil to prevent drying. 
            Each ball is then stretched carefully and skillfully by hand into thin, nearly transparent sheets. Then it is baked
            and served for everyone's enjoyment.</p>
