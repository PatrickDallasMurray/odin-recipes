            <!-- Description of mozz sticks -->
            <p>Mozzarella sticks are crispy on the outside, melty on the inside, and totally addictive. 
                They're made by coating mozzarella cheese in seasoned breadcrumbs and frying them to golden perfection.</p>

            <p>Perfect as an appetizer, party snack, or late-night craving, they're best served hot with marinara sauce, ranch, or your favorite dip. 
            The key is freezing the cheese beforehand to keep it gooey, not messy.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>12 sticks of mozzarella cheese (or mozzarella cut a block into ½-inch sticks)</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 cups Italian-style breadcrumbs</li>
                <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
                <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
                <li>Salt & pepper to taste</li>
                <li>Oil for frying (vegetable or canola)</li>
                <li>Marinara sauce (for dipping)</li>
            </ul>
        
        <!-- Steps to make the recipe -->
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Freeze the cheese: Place mozzarella sticks in the freezer for at least 1 hour to prevent melting too quickly when frying.</li>
                <li>Set up your breading station:</li>
                    
                    <!-- breading station -->
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bowl 1: Flour</li>
                        <li>Bowl 2: Beaten eggs</li>
                        <li>Bowl 3: Breadcrumbs mixed with garlic powder, oregano, salt, and pepper</li>
                    </ul>

                <li>Double-dip: Coat each stick in flour, dip into egg, roll in breadcrumbs—then repeat the egg and breadcrumb steps for an extra-crispy shell.</li>
                <li>Optional but helpful: Freeze breaded sticks again for 30 minutes to firm up the coating.</li>
                <li>Heat the oil: Bring oil to 350°F (175°C) in a deep pan. Fry mozzarella sticks in small batches for 1–2 minutes until golden brown.</li>
                <li>Drain & serve: Let them rest on paper towels briefly, then serve hot with warm marinara or your favorite sauce.</li>
            </ol>
